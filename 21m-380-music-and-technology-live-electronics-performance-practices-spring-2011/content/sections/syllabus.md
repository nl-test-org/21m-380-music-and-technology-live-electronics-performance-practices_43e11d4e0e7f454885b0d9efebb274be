A summary [calendar](#Calendar) of topics for each class session is at the bottom of this page.

Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: Two sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course meetings are divided into two categories. Most sessions are topic meetings, which combine lecture, demonstration, listening, and discussion to explore particular areas of focus. Every 5th session is a workshop meeting, which enriches and extends topics through presentation of student work, criticism, and collaborative hands-on experimentation.

General Information
-------------------

### Description

This course examines the history, techniques, and aesthetics of mechanical and computer-aided approaches to algorithmic music composition and generative music systems. Through creative hands-on projects, readings, listening assignments, and lectures, students will explore a variety of historical and contemporary approaches. Diverse tools and systems will be employed, including applications in Python, MIDI, Csound, SuperCollider, and Pure Data.

### Objectives

1.  To gain a critical understanding of the history, aesthetics, and techniques of live electronics instruments.
2.  To develop approaches to interface and system design for real-time performance instruments.
3.  To develop musical creativity and expression in composition, performance, and improvisation with live electronics.

### Assignments

_Reading Assignments_

All reading assignments, unless marked optional, are required. Reading assignments should be completed _prior_ to the scheduled course meeting. Note the specified page numbers, as complete chapters are not always assigned. Taking notes while reading is strongly recommended.

_Listening Assignments_

All listening assignments, unless marked optional, are required. Listening assignments should be completed _prior_ to the scheduled course meeting. Focused and critical listening is required, giving attention to duration, instrumentation, method of production, recording or performance context, notable sonic events, form, temporal design and proportions, aesthetic or historical contexts, and/or critical and subjective responses. Taking notes while listening is strongly recommended. The sonic materials engaged in this class require broad-bandwidth speakers or headphones; small computer or laptop speakers may hide critical sonic details.

_Reading and Listening Discussion Leaders_

For each class, students will be assigned to deliver in-class summaries and commentary on assigned readings and/or listening assignments. For reading assignments, discussion leaders are required to post notes, outlines, key terms, concepts, and/or critical responses. For listening assignments, discussion leaders are required to post commentary on duration, instrumentation, method of production, recording or performance context, notable sonic events, form, temporal design and proportions, aesthetic or historical contexts, and/or critical and subjective responses. Posts should be around 300 words, or about 1 double-spaced page in a 12 point serif font with one inch margins; and must be completed before the start of class.

_Pd Tutorials_

Pd Tutorials are short Pd programming tasks, to be submitted as complete Pd files. Written comments and answers to questions must be included as comments. Each tutorial will be reviewed at the beginning of class on the due date. Tutorials must be submitted via email before class on the due date.

_Controller/Interface/Instrument Design 1 Implementation and Report_

An original design for and implementation of a controller/interface/instrument employing a dual-analog game controller and a Pd synthesis, sampling, or signal processing system. Students must submit the complete Pd code with the written report.

The report is a written document (at least 500 words, or about 2 double-spaced pages in a 12 point serif font with one inch margins) consisting of at least the following sections. (1) A discussion of musical and/or aesthetic motivations. (2) A brief analysis of the system's main components, interface, and sound production techniques. (3) An evaluation of the aesthetic quality of the results and a description of how the system might be improved and expanded.

_Controller/Interface/Instrument Design 1 Draft_

An operational prototype or minimal implementation of the controller/interface/instrument. Students must be prepared to demonstrate and discuss their goals and plans towards completion.

_Controller/Interface/Instrument Design 2 Implementation, Report, and Presentation_

An original design for and implementation of a controller/interface/instrument employing any mechanism and/or sound production process. The system must have at least two performative input parameters. The project report is a written document (around 800 words, or about 3 double-spaced pages excluding citations and bibliography in a 12 point serif font with one inch margins) consisting of at least the following components. (1) A discussion of musical and/or aesthetic motivations. (2) An analysis of the system's main components, interface, and/or sound production techniques. (3) Comparisons to related historical or contemporary musical controllers, interfaces, or instruments. (4) An evaluation of the aesthetic quality of the results and a description of how the system might be improved and expanded.

Students must prepare and deliver a ten minute aural presentation on their design. The presentation should include main points from the project report. Additionally, students must demonstrate the sonic possibilities of the controller, interface, or instrument, treated in isolation and/or in the context of other sound sources and/or music.

An operational prototype or minimal implementation of the controller/interface/instrument. Students must be prepared to demonstrate and discuss their goals and plans towards completion.

_Performance Framework_

A Performance Framework is a creative assignment, completed in small groups, specifying interfaces, procedures, musical materials, and/or interactions for an ensemble performance lasting from four to eight minutes. The performance framework must be delivered in any of the following formats: written graphical, textual, or symbolic notation; sound file or sonic materials; signal processing designs or implementations; and/or interface designs or implementations.

_Performance Framework Draft_

A presentation including a sketch, outline, or preliminary materials and designs for the Performance Framework.

_Assignment Submission and Late Work_

All written assignments, unless otherwise indicated, must be submitted digitally via email attachment. Upon receipt by the instructor students will receive an email confirmation within twelve hours. If a student does not receive an email confirmation, it is the student's responsibility to contact the instructor and/or re-send the assignment.

Digital media assignments, when required, must be submitted (if smaller than 10 MB) via email attachment or (if larger than 10 MB) via a digital delivery service like Pando (free [Basic Version](http://pando.com/)) or YouSendIt (free Lite [account](https://www.hightail.com/)). Upon receipt by the instructor students will receive an email confirmation within twelve hours. If a student does not receive email confirmation, it is the student's responsibility to contact the instructor and/or re-send the assignment.

Late assignments will receive a grade reduction. Students are encouraged to submit all assignments, even if late. Assignments turned in within seven days after the due date will be deducted 20 percent of the total points possible. Assignments will not be accepted one week after the due date or after the last scheduled course meeting.

### Attendance and Participation

Attendance and participation, as integral parts of this course, are required. Excused absences include illness or emergencies communicated to the instructor before the absence. Students are permitted one unexcused absence without penalty. Beginning with the second unexcused absence, the final course grade will be reduced 3% with each additional absence. If a class is missed, it is the student's responsibility to make-up any missed work.

Always arrive to class on time. Early departures are not permitted. Frequent tardiness may negatively affect final course grade.

### Quizzes and Exams

Throughout the semester there will be occasional in-class quizzes. These quizzes will require short, written responses. These quizzes will ask questions about material presented in lecture, readings, and listening assignments.

If a quiz is missed, it is the student's responsibility to take the quiz at the beginning of the next (and only the next) class meeting. Quizzes cannot be taken more than one class meeting after the quiz was originally given.

There will not be a final exam for this subject.

### Grading

The final course grade will be determined from the following components:

| COURSEWORK | GRADE COMPONENT |
| --- | --- |
| Reading and Listening Discussion Leaders | 10% |
| Pd Tutorials | 10% |
| Controller/Interface/Instrument Design 1 Implementation and Report | 15% |

Grading policies, the use of grade modifiers, and additional grades will be given in accordance with policies set forth in the MIT Course Bulletin, [Academic Procedures and Institute Regulations](http://catalog.mit.edu/mit/procedures/). Grades are given on written assignments based on the following criteria. An _F_ is given for incorrect, incomplete, and unsatisfactory work that demonstrates neither effort nor critical thought. A _D_ is given for incomplete and unsatisfactory work that demonstrates some effort and minimal critical thought. A _C_ is given for complete and satisfactory work with little or no creative or critical thought. A _B_ is given for thorough, well-written, and well-presented work with some creative and critical thought. An _A_ is given for substantial and creative original work and critical insight, executed without flaw.

Grades will be reduced for poor writing and/or an unreasonable number of grammatical errors. Grades are given for class participation based on the quality, relevance, creativity, and insight of aural questions, answers, and discussion points based on assignments, lectures, in-class demonstrations, or other student's work. As much as possible, participation grades follow the standards for written assignments as presented above.

### Academic Integrity, Intellectual Property, and Plagiarism

Students are encouraged to discuss course content with other students taking the course. Each student must, however, produce their own original work. Students are expected to observe the highest levels of academic integrity. All cases of academic dishonesty will be taken very seriously. For more information on academic integrity, citing sources, and plagiarism see [Academic Integrity at MIT](http://web.mit.edu/academicintegrity).

Assignments may involve using digital media or intellectual property produced by others. Materials used in such situations, and provided by the instructor or obtained from the internet, must be either in the public domain or licensed specifically for shared use. Students are expected to follow all relevant copyright and intellectual property laws.

Plagiarism includes using the words, ideas, or creative works of another writer or commentator without acknowledgment. It does not matter where these words or ideas are found or if they are signed or anonymous. When using or referencing ideas that are not your own, a citation must be provided. It is the student's responsibility to understand what is plagiarism and how to cite sources. Parenthetical in-text MLA-style citations are acceptable. Footnotes are optional.

In the case of unattributed and/or suspicious student work, software may be used to search the internet, literature archives, and current and past assignments for possibly-plagiarized material.

Suspected cases of academic misconduct will be handled according to section 10.2 of [MIT Policies and Procedures](http://web.mit.edu/policies/10/10.2.html).

Unauthorized use and distribution of student-recorded or transcribed course lectures or materials, without written permission of the instructor, is prohibited.
